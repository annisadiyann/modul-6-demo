Final Fantasy XII,92.0,76.0,['playstation-2'],"The story takes place in a world called ""Ivalice,"" in an age when magic was commonplace and airships plied the skies - the Archadian Empire, seeking to strengthen its base of power, had been invading and subjugating its neighboring lands one by one- a fate which befell the small Kingdom of Dalmasca. Archadia's invasion and the subsequent death of the Dalmascan king prompted the Princess Ashe, the sole surviving heir to the Dalmascan throne, to take up arms against the invaders. In her struggle to oust the occupying Archadian forces and restore freedom to her people, Ashe must watch as many of her allies pay the blood price for that freedom. Though tempted to abandon all hope in the face of the Empire's might, her determination keeps her from succumbing before what would seem to be inevitable defeat. Then she meets Vaan, an urchin from the Dalmascan capital of Rabanastre. Vaan dreams of one day becoming a sky pirate, escaping the Empire on his airship. Vaan, Ashe, Vaan's friend Penelo, the sky pirate Balthier, his partner Fran and many more are on an adventure through Ivalice that traces the mysteries behind the Archadian Empire's invasion. Bringing with it a wide array of new gameplay elements, Final Fantasy XII will change the way players think about the Final Fantasy series. Numerous possibilities abound within each scenario, allowing for a less linear, more unique experience for each player.

Katamari Damacy,86.0,88.0,['playstation-2'],"(Also known as ""Katamari Damashii"" )  In Katamari Damacy, players take on the role of Prince of the Cosmos, whose father ­ the great King ­ managed to inadvertently knock the stars out of the sky. As the prince, a player's duty is to clean up the King's mess and re-create the starry skies by rolling around the cleverly designed locations to collect objects and build up their 'katamari' -- a Japanese word for clump or large mass. The catch is that it's not the quality or the actual number of objects gathered that is most critical to the player's success, but instead the sheer size of the player's 'katamari' that is most important. Along the way, players can roll over hundreds of unusual objects of all sizes and shapes including cookies, cars, mermaids, planes, clouds and even people. The larger the player's 'katamari' grows, the more objects the player can amass along the way -- thus proving if you want to succeed in Katamari Damacy -- size does matter. Katamari Damacy features a single-player story mode and a two-player battle mode. The simple game play mechanics allow for optimal ball rolling and object collecting fun.

Begin your odyssey at the dawn of life as a simple microbe just trying to survive, then use the fun, intuitive Editors to evolve the creature from its microscopic origins into an intelligent, tool-using race. Guide your species as it builds (and the player designs) villages, buildings, cities, and vehicles. Along the way to becoming a global civilization you can choose whether to hunt or forage, attack or trade, be nice or play rough. All the action takes place in a huge, lush world populated with creatures evolved by other players and shared over SPORE's central servers. When it's ready, your one-time pond scum launches into space in its UFO on a grand voyage of discovery, planet forming, or destruct-ion. As you explore and play in this limitless universe of unique worlds, your personal Sporepedia tracks all the creatures you've met and places you've visited. Take complete control of your creature's fate as you guide it through the following six evolutionary phases: Tidepool phase: Fight with other creatures and consume them to adjust the form and abilities of your creature. It's survival of the fittest at the most microscopic level. Creature phase: Venture onto dry land and help your creature learn and evolve with forays away from your safe haven. Carnivore or Herbivore? Social or Independent? The choice is yours. Tribal phase: Instead of controlling an individual creature, you are now caring for an entire tribe of your genetic craftwork. Give them tools and guide their interactions as you slowly upgrade their state of existence. City phase: Bring your creatures' race into a new golden era by building up the technology, architecture, and infrastructure of their city. Civilization phase: Once your city is established, your creatures begin seeking out and interacting with other cultures. You can have them do so with an olive branch or a war cry—either way, the goal for your creatures is to unify the planet.

Danmaku Unlimited 3,84.0,81.0,['switch'],"Inspired by classic Japanese shooting games, Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a lovingly crafted medley of the best aspects of Japanese bullet hell games, all in a polished, accessible package.

An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time?
Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer.

Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play.

Okay, so how does the game do that?
CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire.

GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely ""graze"" it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss.

SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane.

All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.
I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then?
The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.
Is there a story?
It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?
How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!
Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics!
Anything else?

Ranging from the elementary five by five grids to highly complicated twenty by twenty grids, this mode can keep even the most hardened gamers happy. Those less certain of their skills can opt to receive clues to help finish puzzles, or get a head start with a roulette-style hint function that reveals one line of the puzzle. Bring your individual talents to the table with My Picross Mode, in which you can create your very own puzzles to share with your friends (locally, or via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection). Designing your own puzzles is simplicity itself thanks to the easy-to-use stylus and Touch Screen. For that extra personal flair, you can even design the image beneath the puzzle which is revealed upon completion. A variety of unlockable skins - with themes ranging from nature to sports or video game heroes – give you all the customisation tools you’ll need to make Picross DS fit your style.

Story:
In a far future, Earth was devastated by mutants who took control after a worldwide catastrophic event known as ""the big pulse"", a global scale electromagnetic pulse that put an end to all electronic technology on the planet. Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by ""The Boss"" in a world ruled by ""the law of the jungle"".
However, not everything is lost two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!

Main Characters:
Gal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She's an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don't have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.

Ricardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He's not very fast and his technique isn't as good as his comrades', but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He's capable of destroying any enemy in record time!

F. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He's the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as ""the forbidden technique"". While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.

But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries.

So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of ""goblinization"", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.

Fast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technologya continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrixa network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporationsmonolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.
